# car_store_backend
This is a demo car store management system

The main idea is to create a Car Store Management System just for practice, i'm reusing some functions from an old project i made by myself called BugExterminator which is a Bug Tracker
you can obtain more info from this project at my GitHub Repositories.

For this project I'm going to use information from www.mysqltutorial.com for faster development.

The frameworks that i'm using on the backend are: Hibernate, JPA, Maven, Spring, Spring Security, Spring Boot.

I'm reusing and adapting some functions of the older project, like Users, Upload images, Notifications, Oauth2 configurations and SpringSecurity Configurations.
Today i just add the "Product Lines Rest API", to get, create, update and delete.
